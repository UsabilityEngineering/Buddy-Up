# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Buddy Up’s goal is to connect gym-goers to potential gym partners. In this requirements gathering phase, we collected information to help us understand the needs and current habits of potential users.

We surveyed people interested in going to the gym to understand their habits and desires:
Our online survey received (n=42) responses
* There is a mix of __experience and comfort levels__ with the gym:
  * __40%__ of respondents report __never going to the gym__
  * __40%__ of respondents go to the gym either __daily or several times a week__
  * Respondents __tend not consider themselves to be experienced with gym equipment__
    * On a 5-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) the __average was 2.4__
  * Most respondents find that __going to the gym solo is intimidating__
    * On a 5-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) the __average was 3.9__

* People have multiple reasons for going to the gym:
  * __88%__ had more than one __reason for going__
  * __Strength training, cardio, weight loss, and lifestyle improvement__ were the most __common goals__

* Respondents tend to want a __single, long-term gym partner who share their interests and will motivate them__:
  * __74%__ of respondents would __prefer a single gym partner__
  * __76%__ would prefer a __long-term gym partner__ (lasting months or years) 
  * Most respondents agreed that __sharing common interests with their gym partner was important__
    * On a 5-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) the __average was 3.8__
  * Respondents commonly __felt that they needed someone to motivate them to go to the gym__
    * On a 5-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) the __average was 3.6__ 
  * __33%__ of descriptions regarding the respondents’ __best gym experiences included mentions of going with other people__

* Respondents prefer if __gyms are close by and not too busy__:
  * __40%__ would __*not* travel more than 5 miles to a gym__
  * __42%__ of descriptions regarding the respondents’ __worst gym experiences mentioned the gym being too busy__

From our requirements gathering, we’ve discovered the following:
  * Gym-goers need a way to __express their experience level with the gym__
  * People want __gym partners who they connect with__, facilitating __communication between users__ is essential and users may desire a way to __quickly learn about or match with a potential partner__
  * Many people report __bad experiences when the gym is busy__ and may want a way to __avoid peak hours__
  * Most are __unwilling to travel far__ to go to a gym; __proximal establishments would be preferable__

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

**Executive Summary**

In this interaction design phase, we have created wireframes and click-through prototypes that reflect the needs of our users.

**Wireframes** are **basic framework of the project’s layout**, giving us an idea of where to place different elements, without needing to code. The **click-through prototype** provides an **interactive experience** and **illustrates the different flows that users may experience** when using our app.

Both the wireframe and click-through prototype feature:
* Pages for **signing up**:
  * Each page represents different details to **build the user’s profile**, such as **name, age, photos, hobbies, experience level, goals, activities of interest, and gym location**
* Pages for **logging in**
* Pages for **resetting a password**
* **Home page** featuring different **users’ profiles** and the **buttons for matching or rejecting**
* Pages for showing a **detailed view** of **users’ profiles** 
* A page for **editing the user’s own profile**
* Pages to show **how users message one another**
* A **menu** that has buttons for **navigating the app, customizing settings, logging out, and account information**
* Pages showing **settings and informational pages**

# Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

**Executive Summary**

For the final phase of the project, we received feedback from our heuristic evaluations and used cognitive walkthroughs to modify the click-through prototype. From those findings, we finalized our higher fidelity click-through prototype and created a protocol to prepare for a pilot evaluation and usability test. 

**Heuristic evaluations** are a way of **measuring usability problems** within the user interface design, typically judged against common, recognized usability principles. 

**Cognitive walkthroughs** are similar in that it identifies usability issues within interactive systems by **identifying the user goal**, the **tasks** to accomplish the goal and recording the **experience** while completing the tasks. 

**Protocols** define the way in which a usability testing session will be executed. This includes the **script and instructions** that the moderator will follow and read aloud to the user. 

Our protocol includes:
* An **introduction** to familiarize the user with what is about to take place
* **Background** questions to survey the user’s prior experience of meeting new people
* Various **tasks** to **evaluate the user’s experience**
  * **Creating** an **account**
  * Looking for **someone matching specific criteria**
  * **Editing** profile and settings
* **Ratings** on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being Difficult and 5 being Easy, for **each task**
* A section to **wrap up** the user test and ask users to rate **their overall experience** with the app
