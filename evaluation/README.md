# Usability Evaluation

### Explanation of Tasks

#### Task 1

For Task 1, participants are asked to create an account on the app. They are given basic instructions that involve selecting a gym within a few minutes of their home and indicating interest in weight loss and strength improvement. Participants are also told that they want to express their interest in movies, indicating that the corresponding category should be selected when choosing from hobbies. Once complete, participants are asked to rate the ease by which the process was completed.

Task 1 primarily seeks to gauge the effectiveness of the sign-up process, examining if users are able to select options that reflect their needs and interests. If they are able to complete the process while selecting the proper information, it is likely that the sign-up process is effective. As an account is required to use the app, an effective sign-up is key to the overall effectiveness. 

#### Task 2

During Task 2 participants are told to pretend they are a new gym-goer who is looking for a more experienced person to help them get started. They are also told that they are looking for a gym near CSU, Chico. This information should be used to filter potential matches by examining profile information of other users. Once complete, participants are asked to rate the ease by which the process was completed.

Task 2 gives insight into the learnability and effectiveness of the matching process, which is one of the app’s core features. On the learnability side of things, the task lets us observe if users can figure out how to get information on other users and successfully match with others. On the effectiveness side, it allows us to see if users can use the given information to successfully find a match with all or most of their requirements. 

#### Task 3
Task 3 asks participants to make changes to their profile, giving them instructions to change their profile pictures, gym location, experience level, and activities. Once complete, participants are asked to rate the ease by which the process was completed.

This task focuses on gauging learnability, error tolerance, and effectiveness. If the app is learnable, then users should have little problem finding the page and options to edit their profile. If editing can be done successfully then it provides users a way to fix any mistakes that they may have made during sign up. Being able to update gym, goals, and experience is also important to reflecting users’ locations and improvements, which is important the app effectiveness.
